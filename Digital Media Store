I worked with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables 
for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. 

#Get to know the customers table
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers;

#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

Consolidate the first and last name to create a fullname:
SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Full_Name, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'USA';

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, 
Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Full_Name, Invoiceid, 
InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust
on inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Full_Name, title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales%';

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries 
from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT(BillingCountry) 
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS Sales_Agent_Name, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
ORDER BY Sales_Agent_Name;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, 
and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT i.Total AS Invoice_Total, c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS Customer_Name, 
c.Country, e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS Sales_Agent_Name
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;

This query shows each customer and the total amount they spent:

SELECT c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS Customer_Name, c.Country, 
e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS Sales_Agent_Name, SUM(i.Total) AS Total_Invoice
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
GROUP BY c.CustomerId
ORDER BY Total_Invoice DESC;

#8. This shows how many invoices there were in 2009.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9. This shows the total sales for 2009
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. This is a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID:
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#11. This is a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID:
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#12. This is a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre:
SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

#13. This is the total sales that was made by each sales agent:
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#14. This shows the sales agent that made the most money in sales in 2009:
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
